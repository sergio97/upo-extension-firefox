1. POST hard-coded data to UpoOpu to prove protocolbuffers working and format is correct
1. post parsed data to UpoOpu
1. MVP achieved, but not feature parity with existing extention
1. get fancy HTML-modifying code ("extension content") working

TODO Later
==========

1. Get .proto files into the repo and a gulp target for building them
1. conform to some kind of naming convention!
1. Remove global variables from parsers.js
  1. selfData could come from a context object that is passed in when
	 the parser is initialized
1. decide if we should use backticks for strings w/ variables
1. go through code and use "const" and "let" where appropriate
1. Improve format of protocolbuffers data (ie. armies should be a list instead of 5 hard-coded values)
